## About Patient Experience Tracker Project

The Patient Experience Tracker is an online data collection tool that is intended to capture the Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and the Patient Reported Experience Measures (PREMs). The end goal of this project is to facilitate collecting PROM/PREM information and monitoring the health status of patients in order to observe any progress/decline in symptoms and health condition. Currently, if a patient is being monitored by a clinician at Dr. Montelpare's clinic, the patient has to make frequent visits to answer questions and explain their health status and symptoms.This project aims to create a website that allows clinicians to monitor patients with ease by asking them to fill out surveys and update their health status online. Also, when enough data is collected from patients, machine learning algorithms can be applied to detect any common patterns observed within a specific category of patients, which would help clinicians spot possible relationships and derive conclusions
